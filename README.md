## Installation

Firefox: [Mozilla Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/linkding-extension/)

Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkding-extension/beakmhbijpdhipnjhnclmhgjlddhidpe) 

## Manual installation

### Firefox

Run the build as described below and then follow the instructions [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing) to load it into Firefox.

### Chrome

Run the build as described below and then follow the instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest) to load it into Chrome.

## Build

**Requirements**
- Latest LTS Node version (v14)
- Latest LTS NPM version (v6)
- bash
- npx (included with npm v5.2+)

Internally, we use `web-ext` to bundle a distribution package for the extension for Firefox. You do not need to install `web-ext`. Note that `web-ext` will generate a zip file which can also be used for the Chrome Web Store.

Then run the following bash script to generate a build (might need to make the file executable using `chmod +x build.sh`):
```
./build.sh
```

The script does:
- Install all dependencies using NPM
- Runs rollup to transpile and minify source files, with output written to `build`
- Run web-ext to package the extension for uploading to the Mozilla addon store

After the build the root directory contains the complete, unpackaged extension. Use the `manifest.json` file to load it manually into the browser.

The packaged extension can be found in the `web-ext-artifacts` folder.
